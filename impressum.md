## 1. General idea

- **How does #swissguesser work?** &mdash; We tweet an aerial photo of Switzerland. Reply as soon as possible with your guess of the municipality or place shown in the image. The fastest correct answer scores 5, 10 or 20 points, slower ones score a fifth of that.

- **What about privacy?** &mdash; If you score, we display your Twitter handle, your all-time and 30-day #swissguesser score and rank on our public leaderboard at <a href="https://swissguesser.github.io/leaderboard">https://swissguesser.github.io/leaderboard</a>
. If you don't want this, please let us know in a Direct Message to <a href="https://twitter.com/swissguesser/">@swissguesser</a>
 indicating your Twitter handle. See <a href="#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="#datenschutzerklÃ¤rung">Privacy Statement</a> below.

- **How will you know if your #swissguesser answer was correct?** &mdash; If you were the first to submit a correct answer, <a href="https://twitter.com/swissguesser/">@swissguesser</a> will mention and congratulate you. If you were correct but not the fastest, we will like your answer tweet. If there is no interaction, you were off &ndash; better luck next time!

- **You want to know your current score?** &mdash; Simply go to the leaderboard at <a href="https://swissguesser.github.io/leaderboard.">https://swissguesser.github.io/leaderboard.</a>
. Or ask <a href="https://twitter.com/swissguesser/">@swissguesser</a> by tweeting Â«scoreÂ» (or more politely, for example: Â«What is my score, please?Â» ðŸ˜‰) at us. We'll do the calculations and send you your current rank and stats.

- **How does #swissguesser decide on how many points to award per challenge?** &mdash; We decide based on image difficulty, which in turn is defined by what is shown in the image. We award 5, 10 or 20 points per challenge &ndash; you can (try and) bribe us with chocolate ðŸ˜‰.
